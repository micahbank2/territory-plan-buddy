# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-26)

**Core value:** The app must never silently lose data. Every edit must either persist to Supabase or visibly fail with a clear error.
**Current focus:** Phase 04 — ai-capabilities

## Current Position

Phase: 04 (ai-capabilities) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 2
Status: Ready to execute

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Make archive real (not remove UI): User wants soft delete + restore — requires `deleted_at` schema change in Supabase dashboard (no CLI access)
- Include AI capabilities in-app: AI features built as targeted buttons, not a chat interface
- Mobile: audit-and-fix approach deferred to v2 (UX-V2-01 through UX-V2-02)
- [Phase 01-data-integrity-security]: Used it.todo() for all stubs requiring unimplemented functions; smoke test validates mock wiring without needing hook changes
- [Phase 01-data-integrity-security]: Rollback pattern: snapshot before optimistic update, restore on DB error + toast.error — no silent data divergence
- [Phase 01-data-integrity-security]: Direct single-row CRUD for interactions/notes/tasks replaces delete-all + re-insert; callers migrated in ProspectSheet and ProspectPage
- [Phase 01-data-integrity-security]: Use DOMPurify allowlist for XSS prevention; meeting-prep routed through Edge Function to remove VITE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY from client bundle
- [Phase 01-data-integrity-security P04]: deleted_at filter in app queries only (.is('deleted_at', null)) — NOT in RLS policy to avoid WITH CHECK violation on soft-delete UPDATE
- [Phase 04-ai-capabilities]: STATUSES constant added to prospects.ts (was quirky-buck only) to enable ContactPickerDialog status filter on main
- [Phase 04-ai-capabilities]: savePendingBatch called in handleGenerate (not handleCopy) so batch persists before clipboard copy

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **Phase 1 (soft delete):** Supabase RLS policy must be tested with authenticated client before shipping — applying `deleted_at IS NULL` to UPDATE WITH CHECK will block the archive write itself; apply only to SELECT policies
- **Phase 2 (TanStack Query):** Verify `.throwOnError()` behavior with Supabase JS v2 before migrating mutations — without it `onError` never fires
- **Phase 4 (streaming):** Validate streaming Edge Function setup against existing `draft-outreach` function before building new AI Edge Functions
